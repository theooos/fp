How to get the files
--------------------

Run this from a workstation::

    $ git clone https://github.com/uob-fp/fp fp
    $ cd fp/Scrabble
    $ sh install.sh

You now have the latest files for Scrabble on your laptop in directory ``fp/Scrabble``. To play around with the sample solution, run this command::

	$ ghci -package-db=Bram/ghc Scrabble

You will fill in your answers to the exercises in ``Scrabble.hs``. For complete information, look in that file.

From time to time, we may release new versions to fix problems. You can update to a newer version simply by running ``git pull`` inside ``fp``. We will notify you when newer versions are available.

----

You can also use Git from your laptop or home machine if you install it.

.. In case of problems

.. Although we prepare the test bench with care, it is always possible that there is a bug. As usual, if you .. suspect there might be a problem, please report it on Facebook.

Frequently asked question
-------------------------

**Q: I'm getting this error message! What do I do?**

**A:** If you get this error message ::

    GHCi, version 7.6.3: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
    ghc: panic! (the 'impossible' happened)
      (GHC version 7.6.3 for x86_64-unknown-linux):
            While parsing "Bram/ghc/package.cache": too few bytes. Failed reading at byte position 993

    Please report this as a GHC bug:  http://www.haskell.org/ghc/reportabug

then you must execute the following command ::

    module load ghc
    
before restarting ``ghci`` with ::

    ghci -package-db=Bram/ghc Scrabble

In case of difficulty

We will do our best to help you in the labs. Outside the labs, Facebook_ is often a very good resource.
